## ZSJ_OS_Private

It was private before. But now the course has finished, so I made it public.

ZSJ = "珠三角". 3 members from "ZSJ" in total are in charge of finishing this project.

ZSJ_OS is developed based on ZJUNIX, see https://github.com/ZJUNIX/ZJUNIX-Exp. 

It is an mini-OS running on a FPGA board.

**My work**:

+ **src/kernel/pc/**: The Process Control module
+ **src/kernel/schedule/**: The Process Scheduling module
+ **src/kernel/syncronization/**: The syncronization module
